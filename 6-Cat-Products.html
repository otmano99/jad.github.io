That means there is only so much time for you to spend with your kitties. And that time is shortened even more when you have to run to the store and get them the things that you both need. And when it comes to cat products, there are certainly necessities for your dear kitten.

                     <p><strong>AMAZON FOR CAT PRODUCTS
</strong></p><p>Well, the great news is that there is, in fact, something that exists. Amazon has the option where you can ‘subscribe and save’. This means you get a discounted, fixed-rate price for these products. In addition, you can pick how often you want to have these items delivered. No more do you have to run out to the store at 8 pm because you’re at of wet cat food and you know the cat won’t stop meowing until they get it. (Trust me, been there. Done that).
</p><p>
</p><p>Now we just get it delivered to our door, and the cats no longer are annoyed with us. (Except of course if we get a flavor they don’t feel like that day, because of cats). So, I wanted to share with you the six things that I get from Amazon’s subscribe and save option that makes my life easier. This allows me to spend more time playing with my cats rather than searching for different toys or food that they may like that doesn’t cost a ton. So why do you spend less time searching the internet for cat products, and see what I use? Don’t worry, I also provide other options, because just because my cats like it, doesn’t mean all cats do.</p>

You use it, you love it, you scoop it. And if you are like me, you hate buying it and usually forget it at the store. Living in an apartment on the second floor, there is nothing quite like carrying two 20 pound cat litter containers up a flight of stairs. &nbsp;<br><br>This was actually the first thing I started to buy on Amazon, and where I found the ‘Subscribe and Save’ Option. I get the cat litter sent to my house every two months, and it comes in packs of two. I look at the grocery store every time I am there, and over half the time, the price is more expensive at the grocery. Now I never have to pick and chose when I can get the litter because it is on sale, or not on sale.<br></p>

The Tidy Cats that I use I show above, you can actually just click the link, or image to see the exact option I use.
</p><p>
</p><p>The other options that can be found on Amazon are <a href="https://amzn.to/2vPFCMd" target="_blank">Arm &amp; Hammer Clump &amp; Seal Platinum</a>, or <a href="https://amzn.to/33b49r3" target="_blank">Fresh Step Scented Litter with Febreze</a>. These are rather just as high by customer reviews as the Tidy Cats as offers different qualities that Tidy Cats may not.
</p><p>
</p><p>I currently have not tried Arm &amp; Hammer or Fresh Step, since the ease of subscribing to Tidy Cats is so simple, but from the customer reviews I’ve done about these two, I may just have to try them out. You can find the options in the links above for those two cat litters. Those are my top two alternatives right now, but if I find any others, I like better I will continue to update this.</p></div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-12"><p><strong>Next is wet cat food</strong>. In all honesty, I am doing these in the order that I decided to start subscribing on Amazon. I actually did not decide to start buying these on Amazon because I wanted convenience. In all reality, my girl kittens are EXTREMELY picky about the type of wet food they like.
</p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">There is nothing worse than going to the grocery store, knowing you need a certain type of food, only to find they are out. Or worse, they don’t have the amount that you need. That means that you have to go back to the store sometime that week, or hope your cats like the other food you get.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Hence the discovery of Amazon. And after that, there really was no going back. It is so nice to know that they are going to get their food delivered at the same time, every month. And it’s the same price! Now I can spend my time at the grocery store picking out one or two random wet food to hope they will venture out.</span></p></div>

So if there are any that I do not list here.</p><p>So what wet food do they like? Well if the image at the top hasn’t told you already, it is <a href="https://amzn.to/2IH0x6W" target="_blank">Fancy Feast Gravy Lovers</a>. They also gravitate towards the Beef option of that, but will usually eat the chicken and turkey when they are feeling wild. I love this option because it is a good portion for each of them. We just dump it on their cute little cat food plate, at let them go to town.
</p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">The other wet cat food that they will eat here and there is <a href="https://amzn.to/2W4imEL" target="_blank">Friskies</a>. I say here and there because there are some nights where Phoebe looks at this food like, ‘seriously?!’ and other times where she just starts eating. It really depends on their mood but I like to give them options.</span></p></div>

</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;We have tried so many different brands and usually can tell they don’t work by being awoken to her hacking and a nice lump of hairball/food mixture (too much information, sorry) on the floor. However, we have been very lucky to find a brand that she not only likes, but doesn’t give her hairballs. And best of all, Wobbles also likes it! It’s really a win/win situation.</span></p></div>

That is less time you have to spend searching the internet for good toys for your babies and more time actually playing with them! 
</p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">I have a crazy helpful tip that I need to share with you guys. There is this toy that my cats are OBSESSED with. And I do not say that lightly. Wobbles will carry this toy around from room to room and has gone through almost two already because she loves it so much.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>ALL OF THE CAT TOYS</strong>!
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">In fact, I have even gotten Phoebe to play with this toy, and she is not one for playing. So what is this toy? It is actually called a <a href="https://amzn.to/2xyuaFf" target="_blank">cat dancer</a>. The best thing about it? The cost! It is so cheap, so simple but my cats go CRAZY! There is also an option to get one with a catnip-filled mouse at the bottom. You can save money, save time, and get a toy that you can use to play with your cats and keep them entertained when you’re sick of playing.
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">If you are not a big fan of the cat dancer, lucky for you, there are so many other options on toys you can get. Lasers, <a href="https://amzn.to/2U3ZJhM" target="_blank">interactive toys</a>, or <a href="https://amzn.to/2wOjlhI" target="_blank">plush toys</a>. If I want to give the girls another toy, I always love to give them <a href="https://amzn.to/2IGpkYM" target="_blank">plush toys that have catnip inside</a>. It gives them something to play with on their own without that sometimes being one of my socks.</span></p></div>

You can compare prices, get free shipping, and get the exact treats you want for your cat. 
</p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Just like their momma, my cats are not picky when it comes to treats. There are some that they like more than others. But if you lay down treats, they will not go uneaten.</span></p>

</strong></p><p>The girls love <a href="https://amzn.to/2xyuQKN" target="_blank">temptations treats</a>, in practically all the flavors. The best thing is you can get them in giant containers which are pretty low in cost. When they are sick of the temptation flavors, I like to mix it up with <a href="https://amzn.to/38FPntG" target="_blank">Purina’s Whisker Lickin</a>‘. This kind is a soft, chewy treat that provides a different texture compared to their dry, crispy temptation treats.
</p><p>
</p><p>When I decided to start adding treats onto my cat products Amazon list, it was mostly out of a lump sum decision. It was one less thing I had to think about at the grocery store, and I could pick and choose which flavors or brand I wanted this week. Luckily, the girls are not too picky when it comes to treats so it was more of a personal decision rather than a requirement.</p></div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-12"><p>Last, but certainly not least is <a href="https://amzn.to/2QaAWaC" target="_blank">Pheromones</a>. Okay, maybe they are kind of least on the list, mostly because they are the last things I decided to purchase on Amazon when it came to cat products. I will admit that sometimes I am a baby cat mom when it comes to Pheromones. As I have said before, pheromones help keep cats calm and feel that their scent is all around the house. This prevents them from feeling that they need to rub everything and put their scent on things. 
</p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">It is also extremely helpful when you are moving from one place to another, or if you are going to be gone for extended periods of time. I usually always make sure I have pheromones whenever we move because it helps keeps the cats calm during the move.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">PHEROMONE CAT MOMMA&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p>This is where the bad momma side of me comes out. When I am at a house for a long period of time, I will sometimes forget to freshen up their pheromones. I know my cats are happy and relaxed in their current environment. Which is why I am not always great about keeping them filled.
</p><p>
</p><p>Luckily, when I got them on Amazon this most recent time, I saw the option to subscribe and save. This means that now I can have the pheromones come to my house every 4-6 months. No longer do I have to worry about forgetting to pick them up. They just show up at my doorstep around the time they need to be changed. This makes my life so much easier in the long run, and probably for some happier cats.</p></div>

These are things that I use in my everyday life with cats, and that my cats like. It saves me time each week to not be shopping for them, stressing about which things to buy and when. And allows me to spend more time playing with my cats with their new toys.&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>
